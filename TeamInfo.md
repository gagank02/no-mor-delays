## Project Summary

We are storing flight delay and cancellation information in our database, starting with information from the year 2015. The primary information includes flight number, origin airport, destination airport, scheduled time of departure, airline, delay time, and/or if the flight was canceled. Simple features will provide useful information to the users on what flights are most reliable for their journey from one location to another during a certain time of year. Complex features will allow users to update our database with flight delays and cancellations they themselves are experiencing.
